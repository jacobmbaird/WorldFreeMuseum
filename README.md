# WORLD FREE MUSEUM

## Welcome to the World Free Museum

The World Free Museum is an open-source collection of historical events and artefacts arranged along a continuum throughout space and time.

## The vision

### Space-time continuum

At the centre of the World Free Museum is a continuum of space and time. All events throughout world history happened across expanses of space and time. The birth of Christ, for example, is believed to have been born sometime on December 25th in the geographical area historically known as "Bethlehem." Because no event happens at a single point in time or space, it is not sufficient to locate events by a singular space-time coordinate. Some events, such as the asteroid bombardment of the Hadean eon and the evolution of multi-cellular life, may play out over hundreds of millions of years and encompass the entire globe. Other events, such as the Roswell incident and the assassination of Julius Caesar, are over within the span of a day and occur within a small locale. Treating historical events in such a manner allows us to visualize their overlap.
